## Addressing

Commands that target a session or workspace take `--target` (default `active`):

- `active` — the selected session / current workspace.
- a full UUID (case-insensitive), or a unique **prefix** of one (git-style). Zero matches → `notFound`
  error; two or more → `ambiguous` error listing candidates.

`window.*` commands take the window id/prefix/`active` as a positional argument. Other commands accept
a global `--window <id|prefix|active>` to operate on a specific window's tree (default: the frontmost).

Scripts rarely type ids: create with `*.new` (capture the returned id), or act on `active`.

**Agents: `active` is almost never your own session.** `active` is the session the USER has selected in
the GUI; your shell runs in `$AGTERM_SESSION_ID`, and the user is usually on a different session while
you work. For any session-scoped command meant to act on *this* session — `overlay open`, `scratch`,
`type`, `text`, `background`, `status`, `copy`, … — pass `--target "$AGTERM_SESSION_ID"`. Omit it and
you open overlays / type into whatever the user has selected, not your own session.
