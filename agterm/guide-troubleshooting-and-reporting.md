## Troubleshooting and reporting

When the user hits a problem (a keymap editor that will not open, a custom action that does nothing,
notifications missing), diagnose it from inside the session first: inspect `agtermctl tree --json`,
run `agtermctl keymap reload` for the parse-diagnostic count, and read the unified logs under
subsystem `com.umputun.agterm`. If it turns out to be a bug, offer to help file it.

**Filing is opt-in and draft-first.** Never run a `gh` command without the user's explicit approval.
Decide first whether it is a bug (a supported feature misbehaving → a GitHub **issue**) or something
not supported / a question / an idea (→ a GitHub **Discussion**, category `Ideas` or `Q&A`). Draft the
title and body, show it to the user, scrub anything private (tokens, hostnames, usernames in paths,
selection/clipboard text), and only post after an explicit go-ahead. If `gh` is missing or not
authenticated, hand the user the prefilled text plus the new-issue / new-discussion URL instead.

Full detail, templates, and the exact `gh` commands are in **troubleshooting.md**.
